BUILDING

I'm very sorry but this is a very hasty source release.
I've included hacked together makefiles for mingw32 and devkitgp2x,
it should be enough to see how things should build.

There are lots and lots of warnings I really should take care of
and the source itself is hacky in places and will need a reorganise
to make it portable. All things on the to-do list.

Note that OhBoy overrides gnuboy's main function by redefining it as
gnuboy_main when compiling.

Please do not hesitate to contact me on the GP32x boards or by email.
I'll do the best I can to help.
